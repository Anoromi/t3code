# Web add project actions panel

Add a project-scoped Mod+P launcher for configured scripts, current source-control workflows, and supported Open In targets. Coordinate it with the upstream command palette and navigation menu, preserve terminal-focus exclusions, and migrate legacy `commandBar.toggle` keybindings to the private `projectActions.toggle` command without reviving the old public command name.

## Reimplementation Sources

This intent reimplements source commit `c678a976e6` against the pinned upstream command palette, sidebar, source-control presentation, editor discovery, and chat header surfaces. It delegates scripts, Git mutations, dialogs, pull-request links, repository publishing, and editor launches to upstream implementations rather than duplicating those workflows.

## Validation Coverage

Unit tests cover configured script and editor descriptors, repository initialization and its running state, changes, ahead/behind/diverged/default-ref states, missing remotes, detached refs, open change requests, loading and error rows, search aliases, modal shortcut disposition, keybinding parsing and labels, legacy command-bar migration, and the frozen pre-navigation generated-keybinding snapshot. Chromium coverage verifies Mod+P focus, search and single execution, routing into the existing Git action flow, editor launching, Escape focus restoration, command-surface mutual exclusion, and blocking unrelated global shortcuts behind the panel.
