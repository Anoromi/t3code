# Web restore keyboard composer actions

Restore keyboard-only `/branch`, `/worktree`, `/reasoning`, and `/fast` composer actions on current upstream provider-instance and VCS command surfaces. Reasoning and fast mode consume the selected model's live option descriptors, preserve unrelated options, and persist sticky selections. Branch selection reuses upstream checkout/worktree rules; ref searches are debounced, non-repositories omit VCS actions, and named worktree branches remain separate from their resolved base refs. Sends and repeated selections wait for pending context changes. The removed `/r` alias is intentionally not restored.

## Reimplementation Sources

This intent reimplements source commit `f2f2edec50` against the pinned upstream provider model descriptors, draft store, thread commands, and paginated VCS queries. It preserves upstream provider slash commands, skills, composer attachments, mobile behavior, and current checkout semantics.

## Validation Coverage

Unit tests cover multiword command parsing, `/r` exclusion, live reasoning defaults and selections, fast-mode option replacement, pending-worktree base selection, toolbar invalidation of named worktree targets, and separate named-worktree persistence. Interrupted server metadata writes never update pending run context. Chromium coverage preserves all source scenarios and adds unresolved-base, non-repository, debounced-search, and repeated-pointer regressions: typed reasoning selection, prompt-injected reasoning application and cleanup, loading-safe named worktrees, the complete bare-slash action catalog, fast toggling, keyboard branch/worktree selection, and `/r` exclusion.
